#Galleria

Simple image gallery

All you have to do is to copy the index.php file to the root folder of your server, and your gallery is ready!

>**Note:**
>In order to make the app single-paged, some files are being fetched from remote servers.
>So it requires an internet connection to function properly.
>The app makes use of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
